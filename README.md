Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

According to The Gender Policy Report from the University of Minnesota, men are more likely to engage in urban cycling than females due to different safety concerns. Studies conducted in Minneapolis showed strong correlations between gender and encroachment: that is, vehicles passing riders less than 3 ft. away from distance.

## Objective

Find relationships or patterns in the data based on gender by using New Yor City, one of the largest metropolitan areas in the world, as reference to verify these findings

## Task
